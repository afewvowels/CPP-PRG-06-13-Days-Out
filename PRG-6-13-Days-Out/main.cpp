//  Write a program that calculates the average number of days a company's employees are
//  absent. The program should have the following functions:
//
//  * A function called by main that asks the user for the number of employees in the
//    company. This value should be returned as an int. (The function accepts no arguments.)
//  * A function called by  main that accepts one argument: the number of employees in
//    the company. The function should ask the user to enter the number of days each
//    emplopyee missed during the past year. The tota of these days should be return as
//    an int.
//  * A function called by main that takes two arguments: the number of employees in
//    the company and the total number of days absent for all employees during the year.
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of employees. Do
//  not accept a negative number for the days any employee missed.
